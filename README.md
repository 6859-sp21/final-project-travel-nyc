# Work

This final project was an individual project; I interacted with peers to get user feedback throughout the development of the visualization.

The technical workload of the project was mostly frontloaded, while the user testing and improvement iterations tooks most of the time between the MVP and the final deliverable. The average workload as 14 hours a week.

# Dataset

The dataset that was ultimately used was NYC's TLC data.

Reprocessing of the data for the new project direction was done roughly halfway through the project due to losing access to key data APIs halfway through the project. This resulted in a lot of reworking of the visualization when ultimately exploring a different aspect of the dataset.
